<p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.</p>
<p>It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.</p>
<p>A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.</p>
<p>Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.</p>
